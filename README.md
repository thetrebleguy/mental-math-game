hello there!

as a part of my english research study for my school, i have decided to conducted a study about the 
effects of calculator on mental math ability among senior high students in my school :D

the methodology that is utilized by the researcher is this website itself! and there are 
20 mental math questions that each participant should do :D, please take note that 
there might be errors and some inconsistency from the questions, but i tried my best to keep
the level of the questions to be the same for all participants

for your information as well
there is NO TIME LIMIT. do your test for how long you desire, 
if you can't answer, then just answer randomly lol

gud luck! have fun :D
