# mental-math-game
a project a made back in senior high school for a thesis! i hope this project inspires other people or other computer science majors out there!

there are 20 questions in the game, it consisted of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentials, square roots, and other things.
i got a 100 for the thesis and honestly it was one of the coolest project i've made
the project itself is done in march 2025, but due to errors from the previous code, i wanted to make it more fresh for the public eye
so here ya go :D

have fun playing the game :)
